#Sinatra App

This is my attempt at doing some TDD/BDD with Ruby again. Just a few examples here and there about doing server-side Ruby. Using branches for the different experiments.

To run the app:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec thin -R config.ru start -p 3000

To run the tests:

    $ cucumber
